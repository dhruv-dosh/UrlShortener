## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run UrlShortener locally.

### Prerequisites

  * Java Development Kit (JDK 17 or newer)
  * Node.js and npm (or yarn)
  * A running instance of MySQL or PostgreSQL database.
  * Maven (for Spring Boot build)

### 1\. Database Setup

1.  Create a new database instance named `urlshortener_db` (or similar).
2.  Update the database connection properties in the backend's `application.properties` or `application.yml` file with your credentials:
    ```yaml
    # Example for Spring Boot (application.yml)
    spring:
      datasource:
        url: jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/urlshortener_db
        username: your_db_user
        password: your_db_password
    ```

### 2\. Backend Setup

1.  Navigate to the `backend` directory (or equivalent).
2.  Build the project using Maven:
    ```bash
    mvn clean install
    ```
3.  Run the application:
    ```bash
    java -jar target/urlshortener-backend-*.jar
    # OR if using an IDE like IntelliJ, run the main application class.
    ```
    The API should start running on `http://localhost:8080`.

### 3\. Frontend Setup

1.  Navigate to the `frontend` directory (or equivalent).
2.  Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    # OR yarn install
    ```
3.  Start the development server:
    ```bash
    npm start
    # OR yarn start
    ```
    The React application should open in your browser at `http://localhost:3000` (or the configured port).

## ü§ù Contribution

We welcome contributions\! If you have suggestions for new features, bug fixes, or improvements, please:

1.  Fork the repository.
2.  Create a new feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`).
3.  Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'feat: Add amazing feature'`).
4.  Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`).
5.  Open a Pull Request.

## üöÄ Future Enhancements

We aim to make the setup and deployment process even simpler through containerization.

### Dockerization

We plan to implement **Docker** and **Docker Compose** to enable users to spin up the entire application stack (Frontend, Backend, and Database) with a single command.

**Goal:**

1.  **Containerize** the Spring Boot API and the React UI.
2.  Provide a `docker-compose.yml` file to link the services, including a database container.

**Future Run Command:**

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```
